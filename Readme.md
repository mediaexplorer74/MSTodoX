## Architecture
![Topology 1](Artwork/Topology1.png)
![Topology 2](Artwork/Topology2.png)

## Status
- UWP / Android / iOS "platforms"
- "Projects" list added only (draft)
- No task list yet, no task control :(
- Settings Page added... and some other pages added for future...
- Min. W10M os build descreased to 10570 (hello, Project Astoria!)

## Problem
MS decided to "switch off" the Task "cloud" sync at mobile version of Microsoft TODO UWP app. 
Date:  Feb, 15 2022.

MS ToDo fow W10M needed to task syncing via Microsoft Graph.

## Goal
Try to reilize/assemble the smalest (simplified) "remake" of Microsoft TODO UWP app (W10M).
