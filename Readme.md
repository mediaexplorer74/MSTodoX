![Topology 2](Artwork/Topology2.png)

## Status
- "Projects" list added only (draft)
- No task list yet, no task control :(
- W10M compatibility added
- Settings Page added

## Problem
MS decides to "switch off" the Task "cloud" sync at mobile version of Microsoft TODO UWP app. 
Date:  Feb, 15 2022.

MS ToDo fow W10M needed to task syncing via Microsoft Graph.

## Goal
Try to reilize/assemble the smalest (simplified) "remake" of Microsoft TODO UWP app (W10M).
